Modify methods of one or more objects for the time of the current Test::Unit::TestCase
test function.

This is interesting to use in two situations:
* Assert that a function (to be tested) has the side effect of invoking a method on a certain object (it can even be asserted that a given call-sequences is taken). This should probably not be used unless the side-effect method(s) can be tested independently.
* Break up a recursive method and test the terminating case and the recursing case independently, instead of (or in addition to) feeding fixtures to the method.
